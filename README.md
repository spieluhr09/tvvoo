# TvVoo — VAVOO Clean Addon for Stremio 📺⚡


## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

CHANNELS ARE NOT GENERATED OR HOSTED BY THIS PROJECT.  They are the result of automated scraping from public third‑party sources. The author is not responsible for outages, blocks, geo restrictions, wrong names/links, or any use of this software. Bandwidth usage depends solely on your own Internet connection and provider.

## Supported Countries

**Countries:**
Italy ,United Kingdom, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Albania, Turkey, Netherlands, Arabic, Balkans, Russia, Romania, Poland, Bulgaria

## Header Toggle

The landing page includes a **Headers** toggle:

- **ON:** Optimized for ExoPlayer and AndroidTV. Use this if you are on AndroidTV or using ExoPlayer-based apps.
- **OFF:** Recommended for all other platforms. If the stream does not start, use an external player (preferably VLC).

The toggle controls whether custom HTTP headers are injected into the stream request. Some players (especially ExoPlayer/AndroidTV) require these headers for playback.

## Channel List & Contributions

The static channel list is located at:

`https://github.com/qwertyuiop8899/tvvoo/blob/main/src/channels/lists.json`

This file contains all non-Italy channels with their name, country, logo, and category. Italy channels/categories/logos are handled separately via M3U.

**Want to help?**
- You can submit a pull request to improve logos or categories in `src/channels/lists.json`.
- Contributions for new logos, better categories, or additional countries are welcome.

## Usage

1. Open the landing page or deploy the server.
2. Select countries and copy the manifest URL or use the Install button.
3. Use the header toggle for ExoPlayer/AndroidTV compatibility.

## Manifest URL

Manifest URLs are generated dynamically based on selected countries and header toggle.

## Fallback

If the link does not open the app, copy and paste the Manifest URL into Stremio.


## Installation 🧩

1) Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
PORT=7019 npm start
```

Open in Stremio: `http://localhost:7019/manifest.json`

2) Select countries (optional)

- Safe path: `http://localhost:7019/cfg-it-uk-fr/manifest.json`
- Exclusions: `http://localhost:7019/cfg-it-uk-fr-ex-de-pt/manifest.json`
- Query variant: `http://localhost:7019/manifest.json?include=it,uk&exclude=de`

3) Configure from the gear

Stremio shows the “Configure” gear. It opens the `/configure` landing where you can quickly build and copy the manifest URL (with flag selection and a “Copy” button).

## Main routes 🔗

- Manifests
	- `GET /manifest.json`
	- `GET /:cfg/manifest.json` (path style: `include=it,uk&exclude=de`)
	- `GET /cfg-:cfg/manifest.json` (safe path: `cfg-it-uk[-ex-de]`)
	- `GET /configure/:cfg/manifest.json` (compatibility)
- Catalog/Stream (also available with cfg prefixes)
	- `GET /catalog/...` • `GET /stream/...`
- Configure (landing)
	- `GET /configure`
	- `GET /:cfg/configure` • `GET /configure/:cfg` (redirect to `/configure?cfg=...`)
	- `GET /cfg-:cfg/configure`
- Diagnostics
	- `GET /health` • `GET /debug/ip` • `GET /debug/resolve?name=...&url=...` • `GET /cache/status`

## Technical notes 🛠️

- Minimal IP forwarding; the signature (`addonSig`) is decoded/rewritten to prioritize the viewer IP
- Catalog cache on disk with daily refresh at 02:00 Europe/Rome
- Logos updated from GitHub (tv-logo) and enriched via M3U
- Useful environment variables:
	- `VAVOO_DEBUG=1` enable HTTP logs
	- `VAVOO_LOG_SIG_FULL=1` log full signature (avoid in production)
	- `VAVOO_BOOT_REFRESH=0` skip refresh at boot

## Deploy 🚀

- Node: project is self-contained (`Procfile` present). Run `npm run build` then `npm start`.
- Docker: use the `Dockerfile` in this folder to build and publish quickly.
